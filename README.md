## Overview

A module to configuring exim as a simple MTA to deliver all mail via a smarthost.
It should be useful for any satellite system that needs to deliver mail via a central relay.

## Module Description

This module will install Exim from EPEL and remove Postfix if it is installed (as installed by default on RHEL based distros).
It will configure Exim to route all mail via the `smarthost` you define and qualify any unqualified mail names with the defined `domain`.
Any mail destined for `root` will be sent to address defined in `root` parameter.

## Setup

### What eximsimple affects

* Exim package
* Postfix package (removes)
* Exim config (/etc/exim.conf)
* Aliases (/etc/aliases)
* Exim Service


## Usage

The default parameters are unlikely to be suitable for your environment, make sure you overwrite them to suitable values:

```
class { '::eximsimple':
  smarthost => 'smtp.mydomain.com',
  root      => 'myteam@mydomain.com',
  domain    => 'mydomain.com',
} 
```

####`domain`

The domain to add to any unqualified mail addresses.

####`root`

The address to send mails for root to.

####`smarthost`

The host to send all mail via. Can be any valid format that Exim accepts. e.g. `smtp.example.com/MX`.

####`local_interfaces`

The interface to listen on. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.

####`host_in_subject`

variable available to puppet.
